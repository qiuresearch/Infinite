# Infinitium
Integrative Nucleic Acid Frameworks: Insights from Algorithms, Data, and Theories

# Goals
* Enlighten the "dark universe" of nucleic acids
* Overcome the data scarcity challenge in science and medicine

## Overview of Our Approaches
* Deploy state-of-the-art algorithms in point clouds, geometric learning, generative flows, foundation models, etc.
* Maximize the utility of available data that are often sparse
* Infuse physical mechanisms into the learning and production stages

## Project 1: Physics-supervised GNN for structure prediction
Here we aim to adopt an established deep learning model for RNA structure prediction and enforce it with physics-based supervision (probably also knowledge embeddings from self-supervised learning).

Deep learning model candidates
* Graphormer: https://github.com/microsoft/Graphormer 
* PaxNet: https://github.com/XieResearchGroup/Physics-aware-Multiplex-GNN
* RNA-FM: https://github.com/ml4bio/RNA-FM

## Project 2: Boltzmann-informed flow matching for structure generalization 
Here we aim to adopt an established deep generative model for RNA structure generation and enforce it with Boltzmann sampling based on physical energy calculation. 

Some candidates are:
* distributional graphormer. https://distributionalgraphormer.github.io/
* RNA FrameFlow: https://github.com/rish-16/rna-backbone-design (the thesis project of an undergraduate student from NUS)
* gRNAde: https://github.com/chaitjo/geometric-rna-design
