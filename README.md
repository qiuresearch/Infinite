# Infinite
Integrative Nucleic Acid Frameworks: Insights from Algorithms, Data, and Theories

# Goals
* Charter the "dark universe" of nucleic acids
* Overcome the data scarcity challenge in nuceic acids science and medicine

## Overview of Our Approaches
* Deploy state-of-the-art algorithms in point clouds, geometric learning, generative networks, foundation models, etc.
* Maximize the utility of available data that are often sparse
* Infuse physical mechanisms into the learning and production stages

## Project 1: Physics-supervised GNN for structure prediction

## Project 2: Boltzmann-informed flow matching for structure generalization 

## Project N: Physics Directed Artificial Biology: Infuse natural laws to data-driven discoveries
## Project N: Artificial physics: Bring thought experiments into virtual reality
